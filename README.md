## HW1
* Fill in some lines in the vertexshader
* Transform the teapot as follows: (use matrix, not gl function) 1) Scale the teapot by 1.0, 1.5 and 0.5 along the x-, y- and z-axisrespectively. 2) Rotate the teapot by 45° around the x-axis. 3) Rotate the teapot by 45°around the y-axis.
* Rotate the camera around they-axis
